## About Me

Hello! I'm a mid-level full-stack developer with extensive experience in various technologies and frameworks. My main focus is building efficient and high-quality web and mobile applications. I'm constantly honing my skills and learning new technologies to tackle the most challenging aspects of development.

## Technologies and Tools

Here's a list of the main technologies and tools I work with, along with their functions:

### Frontend

- Next.js: A React framework for server-rendered applications that provides features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and efficient routing.

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications.

- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, helping to catch errors during development and improving code maintainability.

- React Query: A data-fetching library for React applications that simplifies API calls and state management for asynchronous data.

- Chakra UI: A modular and accessible UI component library for React that allows for rapid UI development.

- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-defined classes for rapidly building custom UI components.

### Backend

- Nest.js: A progressive Node.js framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications using TypeScript.

- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript used on both frontend and backend to add static typing and improve code quality.

- Prisma: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database access and management with TypeScript support.

- Firebase: A platform provided by Google that offers various backend services, such as authentication, database, and cloud functions, making backend development easier and more scalable.

- PostgreSQL (Postgres): A powerful open-source relational database management system that is known for its reliability and robustness, widely used in web applications.

- Keycloak: An open-source identity and access management solution that provides Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality and secure user authentication for applications.

### DevOps

- Docker: A platform that enables developers to package applications and dependencies into containers, ensuring consistent deployment across different environments.

- Portainer: A web-based GUI for managing Docker containers, making it easier to monitor and administer containerized applications.

- Duplicati: An open-source backup tool that supports encrypted and compressed backups to various cloud storage services.

- Firebase Hosting: Firebase service for hosting web applications, making it simple to deploy and manage web apps.

### Mobile

- React Native: A mobile application framework that allows developers to build cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
